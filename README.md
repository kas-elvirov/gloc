## DISCLAIMER
Github does not have a function to view the total number of lines of code in the project but we can to compute an approximation of that data (LOC: Lines of Code) through the GitHub Statistics API. Some glitches may occur, such as negative loc or unavailable data for many reasons

## History and origins
- **Gloc** means - 'Github lines of code counter'
- Initial version: 2.0.1 ( 2017, 12 february )
- I made this extension in the **Russian Army** while was on duty. My fastest open-source ever )

## Description
Works for **public** and **private** repos

Previosly was counting there but i decided to stop it because it's huge load on the services of GutHub (ethics etc.)
